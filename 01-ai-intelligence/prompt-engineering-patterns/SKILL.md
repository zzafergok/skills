# UX Writing

Write clear, concise, user-centered interface copy (UX text/microcopy) for digital products and experiences. This skill provides frameworks, patterns, and best practices for creating text that helps users accomplish their goals.

**Compatible with:** Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Codex (CLI and IDE extensions)

**Note:** This skill works with Codex CLI/IDE, not ChatGPT. ChatGPT cannot install or use skills.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Writing interface copy (buttons, labels, titles, messages, forms)
- Editing existing UX text for clarity and effectiveness
- Creating error messages, notifications, or success messages
- Designing conversational flows or onboarding experiences
- Establishing voice and tone for a product
- Auditing product content for consistency and usability

## Core UX Writing Principles

### The Four Quality Standards

Every piece of UX text should be:

1. **Purposeful** — Helps users or the business achieve goals
2. **Concise** — Uses the fewest words possible without losing meaning
3. **Conversational** — Sounds natural and human, not robotic
4. **Clear** — Unambiguous, accurate, and easy to understand

### Key Best Practices

**Conciseness**

- Use 40-60 characters per line maximum
- Every word must have a job
- Break dense text into scannable chunks
- Front-load important information

**Clarity**

- Use plain language (7th grade reading level for general, 10th for professional)
- Avoid jargon, idioms, and technical terms
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Choose meaningful, specific verbs

**Conversational Tone**

- Write how you speak
- Use active voice 85% of the time
- Include prepositions and articles
- Avoid robotic phrasing

**User-Centered**

- Focus on user benefits, not features
- Anticipate and answer user questions
- Use second-person ("you") language
- Match user's language and mental models

## UX Text Patterns

Apply these common patterns for interface elements.

### Titles

- **Purpose**: Orient users to where they are
- **Format**: Noun phrases, sentence case
- **Types**: Brand titles, content titles, category titles, task titles
- **Examples**: "Account settings", "Your library", "Create new post"

### Buttons and Links

- **Purpose**: Enable users to take action
- **Format**: Active imperative verbs, sentence case
- **Pattern**: `[Verb] [object]`
- **Examples**: "Save changes", "Delete account", "View details"
- **Avoid**: Generic labels like "OK", "Submit", "Click here"

### Error Messages

- **Purpose**: Explain problem and provide solution
- **Format**: Empathetic, clear, actionable
- **Pattern**: `[What failed]. [Why/context]. [What to do].`

**Error Message Types**

**Validation Errors (Inline)**

- Show as user completes field or on blur
- Brief, specific guidance to correct input
- Pattern: `[Field] [specific requirement]`
- Examples:
  - "Email must include @"
  - "Password must be at least 8 characters"
  - "Choose a date in the future"
- Timing: Real-time or on field exit
- Location: Below or beside the field

**System Errors (Modal/Banner)**

- Show when backend operations fail
- Explain what happened and why
- Pattern: `[Action failed]. [Likely cause]. [Recovery step].`
- Examples:
  - "Payment failed. Your card was declined. Try a different payment method."
  - "Couldn't save changes. Connection lost. Reconnect and try again."
  - "Upload failed. File is too large. Choose a file under 10MB."
- Timing: Immediately after failure
- Location: Modal dialog or prominent banner

**Blocking Errors (Full-screen)**

- Prevent continued use until resolved
- Clear explanation of blocker and resolution
- Pattern: `[What's blocked]. [Why]. [Specific action needed].`
- Examples:
  - "Update required. This version is no longer supported. Update now to continue."
  - "Subscription expired. Your account is paused. Renew subscription to restore access."
  - "Verification needed. Confirm your email to access features. Check your inbox."
- Timing: On app launch or feature access
- Location: Full screen or large modal

**Permission Errors**

- Explain benefit before requesting permission
- Pattern: `[User benefit]. [Permission needed].`
- Examples:
  - "Get notified when orders ship. Enable notifications."
  - "Find nearby stores. Allow location access."
  - "Back up your photos. Grant storage permission."
- Timing: When feature is first used
- Location: In context of the feature

**What to Avoid**

- Technical codes without explanation ("Error 403")
- Blame language ("invalid input", "illegal character")
- Robotic tone ("An error has occurred")
- Dead ends (error with no recovery path)
- Vague causes ("Something went wrong")

### Success Messages

- **Purpose**: Confirm action completion
- **Format**: Past tense, specific, encouraging
- **Pattern**: `[Action] [result/benefit]`
- **Examples**: "Changes saved", "Email sent", "Profile updated"

### Empty States

- **Purpose**: Guide users when content is absent
- **Types**: First-use, user-cleared, error/no results
- **Format**: Explanation + CTA to populate
- **Example**: "No messages yet. Start a conversation to connect with your team."

### Form Fields

- **Labels**: Clear noun phrases describing input ("Email address", "Phone number")
- **Instructions**: Verb-first, explain why information is needed
- **Placeholder**: Use sparingly, only for standard inputs like "name@example.com"
- **Helper text**: Static, on-demand, or automatic based on importance

### Notifications

- **Purpose**: Deliver timely, valuable information
- **Types**: Action-required (intrusive), Passive (less intrusive)
- **Format**: Verb-first title + contextual description
- **Example**: "Update required. Install the latest version to continue."

## Voice and Tone

### Voice (Consistent Brand Personality)

Voice is the consistent personality of the product. Establish voice using:

- **Concepts**: 3-5 key brand principles/values
- **Voice characteristics**: Descriptive adjectives for each concept
- **Do/Don't examples**: Concrete examples showing voice in action

See references/voice-chart-template.md for creating a voice chart.

### Tone (Adaptive to Context)

Tone is how voice adapts to specific situations. While voice remains constant, tone shifts based on user context and emotional state.

**Tone Variables**

- **Purpose**: Why user is seeing this text (information, action, confirmation)
- **Context**: What user is trying to do (learning, completing task, recovering from error)
- **Emotional state**: How user likely feels (frustrated, excited, confused, cautious)
- **Stakes**: Impact of the action (low: changing theme, high: deleting account)

**Tone Adaptation by User Emotional State**

**Frustrated** (errors, failures, blockers)

- Empathetic and solution-focused
- Acknowledge the problem without blame
- Provide clear recovery path
- Example: "Payment failed. Your card was declined. Try a different payment method."

**Confused** (first use, complex features)

- Patient and explanatory
- Break down steps clearly
- Provide context and guidance
- Example: "Connect your bank to see spending insights. We'll guide you through it."

**Confident** (routine tasks, return visits)

- Efficient and direct
- Minimal explanation
- Quick confirmation
- Example: "Saved"

**Cautious** (high-stakes actions, data loss)

- Serious and transparent
- Clear consequences
- Respectful of user's decision
- Example: "Delete account? You'll lose all data and this can't be undone."

**Successful** (completions, achievements)

- Positive and encouraging
- Proportional to achievement
- Brief celebration
- Example: "Profile updated. Your changes are live."

**Tone Adaptation by Content Type**

**Error messages**: Empathetic, reassuring, solution-focused

- Never blame user
- Explain what happened
- Provide clear next step

**Success messages**: Positive, specific, encouraging

- Confirm what happened
- Proportional to action importance
- Brief and clear

**Instructions**: Clear, direct, helpful

- Front-load key action
- Explain why when needed
- Use simple steps

**Onboarding**: Inviting, encouraging, concise

- Welcome without overwhelming
- Focus on value
- Celebrate early wins

**Confirmations**: Serious, transparent, respectful

- Clear about consequences
- No manipulation
- Easy to back out

**Empty states**: Hopeful, actionable, guiding

- Explain why it's empty
- Provide clear next action
- Keep encouraging tone

## Editing Process

Edit UX text in four phases:

### Phase 1: Purposeful

- Does text help user achieve their goal?
- Does text serve business objectives?
- Is value to user clear?
- Are concerns anticipated and addressed?

### Phase 2: Concise

- Remove unnecessary words
- Combine redundant information
- Ensure every word earns its space
- Front-load important concepts

### Phase 3: Conversational

- Read aloud—would you say this?
- Use active voice (unless passive is clearer)
- Include natural connecting words
- Avoid corporate jargon

### Phase 4: Clear

- Use specific, accurate verbs
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Test readability (Hemingway Editor, Flesch-Kincaid)
- Ensure unambiguous meaning

## Workflow

1. **Understand context**
   - User goals and needs
   - Business objectives
   - Technical constraints
   - Emotional state of user

2. **Draft content**
   - Start with conversation (what would you say?)
   - Apply appropriate pattern
   - Consider voice and tone
   - Front-load important information

3. **Edit iteratively**
   - Phase 1: Purposeful
   - Phase 2: Concise
   - Phase 3: Conversational
   - Phase 4: Clear

4. **Test and measure**
   - Review with team
   - Test with users when possible
   - Measure task completion, comprehension
   - Iterate based on feedback

## Accessibility in UX Writing

Writing accessible content ensures all users, including those using assistive technology, can understand and interact with your product.

### Core Accessibility Principles

**Screen Reader Optimization**

- Label all interactive elements explicitly ("Submit form" not just "Submit")
- Write descriptive link text ("Read pricing details" not "Click here")
- Structure error messages to work with screen readers (error + field label read together)
- Use ARIA labels when visual context isn't sufficient

**Cognitive Accessibility**

- Target 8-14 words per sentence (8 words = 100% comprehension, 14 words = 90%)
- Break complex information into scannable chunks
- Use clear headings and logical hierarchy
- Provide consistent, predictable patterns

**Multi-Modal Communication**

- Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning
- Pair visual indicators with text ("Error: Email required" with red icon)
- Provide text alternatives for icons and images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum: 4.5:1)

**Plain Language for All**

- Target 7th-8th grade reading level for general audience
- Define technical terms when first used
- Avoid idioms, metaphors, and cultural references
- Use common, everyday words

### Accessible Pattern Examples

**Buttons**

- ❌ Poor: "Submit" (context missing for screen readers)
- ✅ Good: "Submit application"

**Links**

- ❌ Poor: "Click here for more information"
- ✅ Good: "Read our privacy policy"

**Error Messages**

- ❌ Poor: Red text showing "Invalid"
- ✅ Good: "Error: Email must include @" (with error icon)

**Form Labels**

- ❌ Poor: Placeholder-only fields
- ✅ Good: Visible label + optional placeholder

## UX Text Benchmarks

Use these research-backed metrics to create effective UX text.

### Sentence Length Targets

**By Content Type**

- **Buttons/CTAs**: 2-4 words ideal, 6 word maximum
- **Titles**: 3-6 words, 40 characters maximum
- **Error messages**: 12-18 words (including solution)
- **Instructions**: 20 words maximum, 14 ideal
- **Body copy**: 15-20 words per sentence average
- **Notifications**: 10-15 words for title + body

**Comprehension Rates**

- 8 words or fewer: 100% user comprehension
- 14 words or fewer: 90% user comprehension
- 25 words: Maximum before significant comprehension drop

### Character and Line Length

**Optimal Ranges**

- **Line length**: 40-60 characters for maximum readability
- **Button labels**: 15-25 characters
- **Page titles**: 30-50 characters
- **Notification titles**: 35-45 characters

### Reading Level Guidelines

**By Audience**

- **General public**: 7th-8th grade (Flesch-Kincaid)
- **Professional tools**: 9th-10th grade
- **Technical products**: 10th-11th grade
- **Specialized fields**: 11th-12th grade (only when necessary)

**Testing Tools**

- Hemingway Editor: Highlights complex sentences
- Readable.com: Provides multiple readability scores
- Microsoft Word: Built-in Flesch-Kincaid scoring

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using passive voice excessively
- Generic button labels ("Submit", "OK")
- Blaming users in error messages
- Overly clever humor in serious contexts
- Inconsistent terminology
- Hidden instructions or explanations
- System-oriented language vs. user language
- Too many words (not concise enough)
- Robotic, corporate tone
- Relying on color alone for meaning
- Writing inaccessible link text ("Click here")

## Quick Reference

**Sentence case**: "Save your changes" (not "Save Your Changes")  
**Active imperative for buttons**: "Delete account" (not "Account deletion")  
**User-focused**: "Save time with shortcuts" (not "We offer shortcuts")  
**Specific verbs**: "Delete" (not "Remove" when permanently deleting)  
**Front-loaded**: "Password must be 8 characters" (not "Must be 8 characters for your password")
