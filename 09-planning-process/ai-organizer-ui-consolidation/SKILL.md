# AI Organizer UI Consolidation

## Overview

Transform the AI File Organizer from 70+ scattered CLI tools (31,415 lines of Python) into a unified, beautiful web application that eliminates all terminal interactions. The user (Ryan) has ADHD and cannot use the current system due to overwhelming context-switching between commands. This consolidation is mission-critical.

**Success Metric:** Ryan can organize files, search content, manage VEO prompts, and control system settings without ever opening the terminal.

**Timeline:** 4 weeks (28 days)

**Tech Stack:** React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI + TanStack Query + Framer Motion

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Building the complete frontend UI for the AI File Organizer
- Creating a unified dashboard that replaces CLI workflows
- Implementing ADHD-friendly interaction patterns
- Designing liquid glass (frosted glass) aesthetics
- Consolidating multiple backend Python services into REST APIs
- Creating file organization interfaces with drag-and-drop
- Building rollback/undo systems for file operations
- Integrating computer vision (Gemini) and audio analysis results into UI

## Design Philosophy

### Liquid Glass Aesthetic (macOS Big Sur/Monterey inspired)

```css
/* Core Design Tokens */
--glass-bg: rgba(30, 30, 46, 0.7);
--glass-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
--glass-blur: blur(12px);
--accent-blue: #0a84ff;
--accent-green: #30d158;
--accent-yellow: #ffd60a;
--accent-red: #ff453a;
--accent-purple: #bf5af2;
```

**Key Principles:**

- Frosted glass cards (`backdrop-blur-xl`)
- Subtle borders and shadows for depth
- Smooth 300ms animations
- Binary choices over complex menus
- Immediate visual feedback
- Undo always visible

### ADHD-Optimized UX

See `references/adhd-design-principles.md` for complete guidelines. Core tenets:

1. **Binary choices** ("A or B") not multiple choice
2. **Immediate feedback** - toasts, progress indicators, visual confirmation
3. **Forgiving interactions** - Rollback Center always accessible
4. **Visual hierarchy** - Important actions stand out
5. **No surprises** - Every action is predictable and reversible

## 4-Week Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation + Dashboard + Basic Organize (Week 1)

## Component Architecture

### Layout Structure

```jsx
<BrowserRouter>
  <Layout>
    <Sidebar /> {/* Persistent navigation */}
    <MainContent>
      <Header /> {/* Breadcrumbs, notifications */}
      <Outlet /> {/* Route content */}
    </MainContent>
  </Layout>
</BrowserRouter>
```

### Main Sections (Routes)

1. **Dashboard** (`/`) - System status, quick actions, recent activity
2. **Organize** (`/organize`) - File upload, classification, batch processing
3. **Search** (`/search`) - Unified search across files, emails, VEO clips
4. **VEO Studio** (`/veo`) - Video prompt library, continuity graph, JSON editor
5. **Analysis** (`/analysis`) - Vision & audio analysis results gallery
6. **Rollback Center** (`/rollback`) - Operation history, undo functionality
7. **Settings** (`/settings`) - Drive, space, services, learning, dedup

See `references/component-specifications.md` for detailed component props, state management, and API integration patterns.

## Backend Service Layer Strategy

**Do NOT rewrite Python modules.** Instead, wrap them:

```python
# backend/services/organizer_service.py
from interactive_organizer import InteractiveOrganizer


class OrganizerService:
    """Wraps existing CLI tool for API use."""


    async def classify_file(self, file_path: str):
        result = await self.classifier.classify(file_path)
        return ClassificationResult(
            category=result['category'],
            confidence=result['confidence'],
            reasoning=result['reasoning']
        )
```

**Benefits:**

- Reuse 31,415 lines of battle-tested Python logic
- Faster development (no rewrites)
- Easier debugging (Python unchanged)

See `references/api-endpoints.md` for complete API specification covering all 70+ CLI commands.

## Resources

### scripts/

**`init-frontend.sh`** - Initialize Vite project with all required dependencies. Run this first:

```bash
./scripts/init-frontend.sh
```

### references/

**Essential documentation to load as needed:**

- **`cli-tool-audit.md`** - Complete categorization of all 70+ CLI tools by function (organization, search, analysis, safety, etc.)
- **`api-endpoints.md`** - Full REST API specification for all required endpoints
- **`component-specifications.md`** - Detailed specs for all React components (props, state, API calls)
- **`adhd-design-principles.md`** - ADHD-specific UX guidelines (cognitive load, feedback, forgiveness, hierarchy)
- **`liquid-glass-design-system.md`** - Complete design system (colors, typography, animations, component patterns)

**Usage:** Load these files when implementing specific features. For example, when building the Organize section, read `component-specifications.md` for FileUploadZone and ConfidenceModeSelector details.

### assets/

**Code templates and configuration files:**

- **`package.json`** - All required npm dependencies (React, Vite, Tailwind, TanStack Query, etc.)
- **`tailwind.config.ts`** - Tailwind configuration with liquid glass design tokens
- **`vite.config.ts`** - Vite configuration for optimal build
- **`component-template.tsx`** - Example React component with proper TypeScript, hooks, and styling
- **`tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript configuration

**Usage:** Copy these files directly into the frontend project during initialization.

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Start with Dashboard + Basic Organize** - Get core loop working first
2. **Rollback Center is Non-Negotiable** - This is the trust mechanism
3. **Test with Real Files** - Use Ryan's actual PDFs, contracts, emails
4. **ADHD-First UX Review** - After each component: "Can I do this without thinking?"
5. **Performance Matters** - Target <100ms UI response for all interactions

## Definition of Done

This project is complete when:

1. ✅ Ryan uses the system for 1 week without opening the terminal
2. ✅ All 70+ CLI commands have UI equivalents
3. ✅ Rollback system works flawlessly (tested with real mistakes)
4. ✅ Search finds files across all sources (local, Drive, emails, VEO)
5. ✅ UI feels fast, beautiful, and calming (not overwhelming)
6. ✅ System status is always visible (no "is this working?" anxiety)

**Final Test:** Ask Ryan: "Would you recommend this to another person with ADHD?"

If yes, **mission accomplished.** 🎉
